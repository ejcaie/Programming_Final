The lines where my inventory skills can be found:

1: ellipse, 54 of player
2: fill, 53 of player
3: corners, 19 of main
4: setup, 14 of main
5: random, 13 of hazard 1
6: dist, 138 of main
7: keyPressed, 195 of main
8: ++, 118 of main
9: timer, 111-114 of main
10: playerVelocity, 7 of player
11: println, 115 of main (commented out)
12: if, 25 of player
13: ==, 25 of player
14: ||, 222 of main
15: switch, 45 of main
16: for, 118 of main and while, 85 of main
17: /////////////////////
18: break, 48 of main
19: For loops require a specific number of repetitions, therefore the number of repitions wanted needs to be determined beforehand. A while loop will repeat until its conditions cannot be met, meaning the exact number of repetitions does not need to be determined.
20: startMenu, 61 of main
21: playerStart, 17 of player
22: A parameter is a variable in a function definition. An argument is the value being used in the place of that variable when the function is being called.

25: A class is the instructions on how an object is created. When an object is created, it copies and executes the code from the class so another object can do the same independantly.
26: A constructor function is used to create an object to be used in the main code.
27: Each class having its own tab in processing allows for significantly more organized code as well as keeping said code in seperate files.
28: player, 5 of main
29: new, 5 of main
30: player, 5 of main
31: Although both store a variable to control the number of an object, an array is a static value while an arraylist can be resized throughout the code (at the cost of efficiency)
32:""
33: player, 5 of main
34: ///////////////////////
35: hazard1, 6 of main

37: PVectors are significantly more useful when programming physics compared to float variables, as they are preprogrammed to use several different methods that float variables cannot. Although in theory float variables can do everything PVectors can, they are much less efficient.
38: PVector, 6 of player
39: 1-61 of hazard 5
40: dist, 138 of main
41: 1-61 of hazard 5
42: A normalized vector is a vector that contains a value of 1, however maintains its privous direction. Normalized vectors can be used to limit velocity while not compromising a full range of directional movement.
43: dist, 138 of main
